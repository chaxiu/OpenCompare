# README screenshots

Both images under `docs/assets/` come from the built application — `out/main` +
`out/renderer`, the same build a release ships — driving real temporary directory
trees and a real file pair. No built-in sample, old image or composed artwork is
used.

## Captured commit

- commit: `ef70939d52fc41efc800f05d40c019a2f770b2e0`
- the capture ran on the working tree on top of that commit (`pnpm build`, then
  the script below), so the recorded commit is the resolvable ancestor the build
  was made from.

## Images

| Image | Real session |
| --- | --- |
| `docs/assets/opencompare-workbench.png` | Two real neighbouring directory trees (`left` / `right`) opened through the launch intake: the four states, their counts and both panes. |
| `docs/assets/opencompare-file-diff.png` | A real `src/session.ts` pair opened as a file session: side-by-side character diff with the indicator bar (`data-diff-ruler`) on the right. |

## Reproduce

```bash
pnpm build
node scripts/capture-readme-screenshots.mjs
```

`pnpm build && node scripts/capture-readme-screenshots.mjs` (or
`pnpm screenshots`) is the copyable one-liner; on Node below 22 the script
re-runs itself with Electron's bundled Node, which has the global `WebSocket`
the DevTools protocol needs. The script creates its own
temporary trees under `/tmp`, starts the built app once per shot with the
comparison as launch arguments, waits for the session to settle, captures the
window content through the DevTools protocol and writes both PNGs. It never
imports or reads `src/shared/fixtures/**`.
